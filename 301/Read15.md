# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry
## The time when women stopped coding
In the past a lot of computer pioneers, the people who programmed the first computers were **women** and the number of women studying computer science kept growing until *1984*, the percentage of women in computer science flattened and plunged.
That time, there was the rise of *personal computers*, that every house has one, but these computers were nothing more than a toy the you can only play some games on, and they were only marketed for men and boys.
In the *1990s*, people were only buying computers for boys, even if the girls are interested in them, and that is the cause of why women stopped coding.
Nowadays 51% of the key technology employees in the US are **women**, so the numbers raised again, and even in the collage I study at, my TAs are usually women, and they are all geniuses.
## Why diversity matters to tech companies
Diversity efforts are most successful when they're driven by commitment from company leaders. And after some interviews, with companies CEOs, Joelle Emerson came out with five themes about what is or should be driving their diversity and inclusion efforts:
1. Diverse teams are smarter and more creative.
2. Diverse companies perform better.
3. Companies ara losing out on great talent.
4. Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base.
5. It is the right thing to do.
