## HTTP

The first part of the website address (*HTTP*) tells the browser what protocol to use, so it is capble of describing the location of something in the world from anywhere in the world.
## Rest Concept
The whole world wide web was built on an architectural style called (REST), that provides a resource, resources are just concepts. The URLs tell the browser that there is a concept somewhere and then the browser shows the presentation of that concept.
### API 
There is a concept called Web Services or APIs that indicates the computers can use the internet as people do, to send messages back and forth to each other, but these were designed to more than that, they were designed to have ability to talk to any machine anywhere in the world.
Everything machines have to talk about has a corresponding URL, and that is a machine equivalent of noun.
#### Polymorphism
There is a theory in programming called ***polymorphism***, which means that different nouns have the same verb applied to them. The HTTP applies verbs to nouns, which means when we go to a webpage, the HTTP applies a GET to a URL to present the webpage, any file on the webpage such as a photo, video, etc..., to be presented, the HTTP uses GET on them, That made people to think of HTTP as only a GET but it is more than that, and yet there is no way to use it in its full potential.
