## Growth Mindset
It is the believe that success in life is not only driven by talent or opportunity alone, it can be reached by hard work, effort, facing challenges, and talent; and we consider talent here as a starting point, while the term *Fixed Mindset* is to believe that the only path to success is ***Talent*** 
And here is a comparison between **Growth Mindset** and *Fixed Mindset*

### I have some reminders to keep myself in the growth mindset including:
1. The fact that nobody will be able to know everything in any aspect, so I have to keep learning and looking forward to reach the best level I can.
2. The success of other people reminds me in every challenge I face that if the other could make it, then I can.
3. Remembering the good feeling when I pass through an obstacle.
