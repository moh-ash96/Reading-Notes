#  What Google Learned About Teams
*Julia Rozovsky* was a 25-year-old girl who wanted to be a part of the community, so she applied to business schools and was accepted at Yale school of management.
The school required students to work as groups, so she found a group of smart students that she thought they will lead her to success but later on she was not satisfied in dealing with them because it was all competitive and any fault is counted, and also they are in an infinite fight over leadership, so she decided to find a new group. There was a competition in the school about having a good project to fill a space inside **campus**, so she joined another team and they were so good together and there is no competition between them, it was all friendly, also they got a lot of crazy ideas until they decided to work on a project of microGYM that made them win the competition.
A lot of researches found out that working as teams is so much better than individual work, as problems get solved faster, brain storming, and more than one head are better than only one, so according to that google was struggling to find the best team that has no conflicts and that work together efficiently, there were so many types of teams, including the ones that are friends outside work, and that type is very good type, and another type that is made of people who donâ€™t know each other outside of the conference room, and each one has its positives and negatives. That time Rozovsky was looking for a job that she can study people personality, so she was hired at google community is a team in order to find the best team that google seeks.
At research there were another two kinds of teams, the first one was composed of smart people that work by the agenda and very restrictive to do the work they are assigned to, and they are all have a smart way to figure things up, and the other is made of different types of people; which means there were the smart, the professional, the beginner, the worker ETC., that team is better according to research because it has about every type of people; which means every types of minds and the brainstorming will give great ideas, and everybody can participate in decision making
