## Whiteboard Advice (Communicate)

In an interview, when the interviewer throws a whiteboard question, it is better to follow these steps in order to get the best result:

### * Restate the question

This way you make sure you understand the question and prove it to the interviewer.

### * Ask About Edge cases

After making sure understanding the problem, the inputs and the outputs, you can ask for a potential edge cases, and what is the expected output if they occur.

### * Ask About Test Cases

Ask if there is a test case the function should pass.

### * Write Pseudo-code and Ask If It Makes Sense

Pseudo-code helps with finding the right logic rather than just trying to find the best way for the correct code syntax.

### * Write the Actual Code and Ask if it Looks Good

You should now convert your pseudo-code into actual code,  if you forget some syntax or a method name, you should be able to ask your interviewer for this information, if they give you trouble, just say you’ll leave it as pseudo-code for now. At this point, don’t hesitate to ask if your solution looks good! If it doesn’t they might offer some tips to improve it.

### * Stuck? Ask for Help

If you’re having trouble along the way, it’s not illegal to ask for some help. Just phrase it conversationally. For example:

“I’m a bit stuck here, do you have any tips to nudge me in the right direction?”
