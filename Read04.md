>A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.
>To make a script there are some steps we have to follow including
## 1. *Define* the goal
First, you need to define the task you want to
achieve.
## 2. *Design* the script
To start the design you should split the goal into several tasks and arrange them in a flow chart.
## 3. *Code* each step
Now you must type the tasks you put in the chart is computer language i.e. JavaScript

>In order to learn Java script you should be familiar with two elements:
1. Vocabulary: The words that computers understand.
2. Syntax: How you put those words together to create instructions computers can follow, Computers need to be told every detail of what they are expected to do, and they will do it without question, so you need to learn to "think" like a computer because they solve tasks in different ways than we do.

## Expressions
There are two types of expressions that result in a single value.

### Expression assigning a value to a variable:
Every variable has to be given a value in order to be useful, and we can do that using assignment operator “=” e.g. var color = ‘beige’;
### Expression that use two or more values to return a single value
Here we perform operation on more than one value to have a single value and an example is when we express the value by math, e.g  var area = 3*2; and here the area will be 6
## Operators
Expressions rely on operators since they allow programmers to create a single value form one or more values.
>There are several types of operators, including:
### assignment operator
Assigns a value to a variable; color = ‘beige’;
### Arithmetic operator 
It performs basic mathematical operations using ( +,-,/,*,++,--,%) and follows order of execution
### String operator
It is used to combine strings together using ( + ) symbol 
### Comparison operator
It is used to compare between two values and the return should be true or false, e.g. buy = 5 > 3; here the value will be **false** for buy.
### Logical operators 
Combine expressions and return true or false e.g. buy = ( 5 > 3 ) && ( 2 < 4 ); here the value is **true**
